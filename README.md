# FloatingMenu

A floating menu tool to try out React, check some new webpack features and show off some code.

The project setup is based on [react transform boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate) and my own (somewhat outdated) [new-webpack repo](https://github.com/publicJorn/new-webpack).
